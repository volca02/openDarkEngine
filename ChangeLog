2009-10-08 19:13  volca

	* src/services/room/RoomService.cpp: Room_db version is not a

	  src/services/worldrep/WorldRepService.h: * adding two default
	  media - jorge.png and DefaultRamp mesh
	  * Moving scenenode to Render service again. Should allow us to
	  run opde without renderer
	  * fixing code so property data are not used. Can be slower, but
	  sure is cleaner

2008-03-18 19:58  volca

	* src/services/property/PropertyCommon.h,
	  src/services/property/PropertyGroup.cpp,
	  src/services/property/PropertyGroup.h: Property data not public

	  FIX)

2008-03-13 07:58  volca

	* src/services/worldrep/WRCell.cpp: No texture found does not mean
	  we have to kill opde! Failback to 64x64

2008-03-13 07:57  volca

	* src/services/object/ObjectService.cpp,
	  src/services/object/ObjectService.h: Stability improvement - sort

	  * __STATIC_GEOMETRY dropped. Default and only option now

2008-02-07 11:13  volca

	* src/services/worldrep/LightmapAtlas.cpp: Default intensity to 0,

	* proto/python/test.cpp: Registering object service in test python
	  app

2008-01-20 18:10  volca

	* src/base/dyntype/DTypeDef.h: no more const for getter - it uses
	  cache now

2008-01-20 18:03  volca

	* src/base/logger/logger.cpp: Verbose as the new default log-level
	  (changed a few log lines to be more hidden to lower the amount of

2008-01-20 18:02  volca

	* src/services/render/RenderService.cpp,
	  src/services/render/RenderService.h: No more Position property
	  listening for render service. Object service holds the scenenode

	  * Object service is the marshall of loading/writing, calls
	  prop/link service directly
	  * Obj. service is the holder of scenenode for objects
	  * render service now uses obj. service to get scenenode
	  * obj service fixes - now loads the ObjVec good (hopefully saving
	  will work as well)

2008-01-20 17:57  volca

	* src/main/GameStateManager.cpp: adding obj. service (as it is now
	  the new loader for objects, inevitable)

2008-01-20 17:57  volca

2008-01-03 19:34  volca

2008-01-03 19:31  volca

	* src/services/render/RenderService.cpp: Few rather cosmetic fixes,
	  and sure one that caused segfaults as well

2008-01-03 14:21  volca

	* src/services/loop/LoopService.cpp,
	  src/services/loop/LoopService.h: Bullet proofing of mode v.s.

2008-01-02 21:39  volca

	* src/services/loop/LoopService.cpp,
	  src/services/loop/LoopService.h: Added a must-have function to

2008-01-02 21:38  volca

	* src/services/render/RenderService.cpp: Sane values for render
	  service taken as a loop service

	* src/bindings/LoopServiceBinder.cpp,
	  src/bindings/LoopServiceBinder.h: Adding some must-have's for
	  python. Requester for loop mode chages and requester for loop
	  termination

2008-01-02 21:36  volca

	* src/bindings/InputServiceBinder.cpp: Adding skeleton for
	  InputEvent converter functor (to be used by the PythonCallback)

2008-01-02 21:35  volca

	* src/bindings/ConfigServiceBinder.cpp: Programmer confused ->
	  Programmer less confused (adding PyErr_SetString to give those
	  errors some explanation)

2008-01-02 21:33  volca

	* src/bindings/PythonCallback.h: Adding python callback. This one
	  should fit nicely into all the callbacks used throughout the
	  code. Added for input service commands, where it'll really shine
	  once needed.

2008-01-02 21:32  volca

	* src/services/ServiceCommon.h: Loop thingies: Modes, Masks,
	  Priorities.... GUI and ALL for now. May grow

2007-11-22 20:15  volca

	* PythonDeps.cmake: Cmake script that finds additional python lib
	  deps - the thing that is not done by FindPythonLibs.cmake from

	  found by it.

2007-11-22 20:13  volca

	* cmake/FREEIMAGEConfig.cmake: Adding the freeimage cmake script

	* src/tools/DarkFontConverter.cpp, src/tools/DarkFontConverter.h:
	  Two small fixes:
	  * enable 64bit architectures to work correctly
	  * argv involves the filename as param zero, so no arguments is
	  argc < 2

2007-11-14 12:49  volca

	* src/base/file/File.cpp, src/base/file/File.h,
	  src/base/file/FileGroup.cpp: small fixes for the

	  * Console now understands 'load_mission MISSION_FILE' command
	  * Console now understands 'show_portals X' command (X==1 shows

	* NEWS, src/tools/meshconvert.cpp: * The water portals are really
	  fixed now. The rendering of water works, but needs to be
	  finished.
	  * Updated the documentation of the sources. It should be pretty
	  complete now. Use DoxyGen to generate the documentation.
	  * The material scripts can be used (and are searched) prior to
	  the simple texture-only default materials. Not too complete for
	  now.
	  * Water material script added. If not found, water should be
	  invisible.
	  * Added -Werror compiler flag.
