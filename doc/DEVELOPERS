                        Notes for Developers:            -*-text-*-
                        ---------------------

Last updated on 19-Oct-2008

----------------
- Requirements -
----------------
OPDE needs:
* OGRE3D library, version 1.6
* FreeImage library
* OIS (The part of Ogre SDK under windows, do not install separately)
* CMake
* Python
* For documentation builds: epydoc, texi2html, doxygen and graphviz

Coding
------
There will be a whole coding style document later on, but for now, some simple rules:
* Always document your code
* Think about the way the code looks - will it be readable by others?
* Test before commiting
* Think twice, code once :)

Be sure to update ChangeLog file sometimes. On linux, it can be updated using svn2cl script.

Opde uses Major.minor.patch versioning scheme.

Releases
--------
This has to be decided. Some remarks:
* NEWS file has to be updated before releasing
* Release name has to be decided and put into the main CMakeLists.txt file


Building
--------

Before building
---------------
Ogre3D environment has to be properly set up. To do that, please follow the steps mentioned on ogre3d wiki here: 
http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/Installing_An_SDK

FreeImage is unpacked-only on windows. This means CMake can't find it automatically (unless it's placed in a 
specially defined directory - see below), and the path has to be entered manually into the corresponding CMake 
variable FREEIMAGE_PATH (use cmake gui for that, or cmake's command line parameters). If you'd like to avoid the 
need of manual setting of freeimage dependency, place it into a directory "dependencies" next to the opde build
directory, like this (example windows directory setup follows):

C:\
	Projects\
		opde\
			build\
				...
			dependencies\
				freeimage\
					Dist\
					...
				...
			opde-svn\
				trunk\
					...

In this setup, the "C:\Projects\opde\opde-svn\trunk\" is the source directory (OPDE_SOURCE_DIR in cmake scripts), 
"C:\Projects\opde\build\" is the build target directory (OPDE_BINARY_DIR in cmake scripts), and the 
"C:\Projects\opde\dependencies\" path is dedicated for all the dependencies that can't be installed/found by 
CMake automatically.

CMake tool is used to prepare makefiles/project files for openDarkEngine. The result of successful run of CMake is
a project file or makefile, that can the be used to compile the project. Before compiling, ensure that you set all
the cmake variables to the desired values. The current list of those is:

GENERATE_DOC: Generates a DoxyFile that can be used to create API documentation.
GLOBAL_DEBUG: Enables DEBUG level logging.
PROFILING: (linux only) Enables GNU Profiler usage. Opde binary will generate profiling file if this is used. 
	Can be examined with KProf for example. 


Unix/Linux
----------
On *nix systems, building with the following commands (replace the OPDE_DIR with the directory in which the 
source resides) should be sufficient:

cd OPDE_DIR
cmake .
make

For out-of-source builds (prefered method), create a separate directory that will hold the built files, 
and run cmake with the path to the source directory (the one containing this readme) as a parameter (replace 
the BUILD_DIR and OPDE_DIR with your paths).

cd BUILD_DIR
cmake OPDE_DIR
make

Note: You can also use ccmake instead of cmake, which is a GUI frontend to cmake that will let you change
the variables. That means Doxygen building, build type, debug code building. This works on both windows 
and *nix platforms. Also note a graphical frontend exists for CMake 2.6 and later, called cmake-gui.


Windows
-------

On windows, please ensure that the OGRE_HOME environmental variables is set (should be if the installation was 
done using the ogre sdk). Also ensure that MinGW/Visual C++ make systems are usable. (Cmake should test this 
first time it is run).

Then progress with (from commandline, being in the root directory of OPDE project):

cmake .

or, if you want to select the used generator (for example MinGW makefiles)

cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles"

For list of the generators, use "cmake --help" from commandline - you'll get a list of available generators.

Note: You can also use the out of source build approach as *nix building guide notes. This makes your source
	directory clean. The windows version of ccmake is CMakeSetup.

Please read the output of cmake carefuly. If the makefiles/VC solution is not present, it will give you hints 
about what was wrong.

The result should be compilable by your system (VC / mingw32-make for mingw)

If you have a problem making for Mingw, please ensure that "sh" executable is NOT in path. If it is, and can't
be relocated, select MSYS Makefiles rather than MinGW ones.

Currently, Debug mode in VC is too slow for normal operation. For testing purposes, please use Release mode.

- Setting up -
--------------

Note: For some additional info about setting up the resources for opde, please consult the online wiki as well:
    http://opde.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
    
You will need to initialize resources.cfg, opde.cfg and plugins.cfg for the main executable to work (examples 
use unix style paths, use windows style paths on windows):

resources.cfg
-------------
This file should point to the .crf files used in Dark Engine's games, opde scripts (found in the source tree under scripts/) 
and game specific scripts (scripts/thief1 etc.). It is used when no game type parameter is specified on command line. 
The structure of the file is the same for any of the file names it can be stored as (thief1.cfg, thief2.cfg, shock2.cfg).

Example content:

# -- begin of resources.cfg --
[General]
# For temp files, overrides, etc. Not crucial
FileSystem=./

# Opde scripts path, common scripts:
FileSystem=/some path/opde-svn/trunk/scripts

# Crf files:
Zip=/some path/fam.crf
Zip=/some path/obj.crf
Zip=/some path/books.crf
Zip=/some path/intrface.crf
Zip=/some path/editor.crf
Zip=/some path/default.crf
Zip=/some path/pal.crf

# Scripts for Thief1 (replace the path's end with the game's name):
FileSystem=/some path/opde-svn/trunk/scripts/thief1

# Missions - should point to directory containing the .gam and .mis files
FileSystem=/some path/t1/
# -- end of resources.cfg --

opde.cfg
--------
Couple of keys are supported for now, mainly for debugging purposes. One key is mandatory: "mission", 
naming the mission OPDE should load upon start.

# -- begin of opde.cfg --
# if set to yes, the input's won't be exclusive to OPDE window. Great for debugging
# nonexclusive=true

# Mission file to use. If none is specified, the first mission file from the game is used
mission=miss1.mis

# Mouse and keyboard movement related
move_speed=30
mouse_speed=80
mouse_invert=1

# Debugging enabled - some FPS/Portal stats appear on screen if enabled
debug=true
# -- end of opde.cfg --


plugins.cfg
-----------
This file should point to Ogre plugins. Please consult ogre's docs for more information.
Example content (You'll also probably want to use RenderSystem_Direct3D7 or RenderSystem_Direct3D9 on windows):

# -- begin of plugins.cfg --
# set the path to the Ogre3D's path to plugins, or set ./ here and copy the ones that are needed next to executable
PluginFolder=/usr/lib/OGRE

Plugin=RenderSystem_GL.so
Plugin=Plugin_ParticleFX.so
# -- end of plugins.cfg --

-----------
- Running -
-----------
There is not much to do once the application is run succesfully now. The camera is controlled with mouse nad WASD keys.
Opde binary has one/two optional parameters - t1/t2/ss2, optionaly followed by mission file name (without path).

If the first parameter is specified, the opde binary loads resource declarations from a file named:
t1 - thief1.cfg
t2 - thief2.cfg
ss2 - shock2.cfg
Instead of the default resources.cfg file.

------------
- Problems -
------------
* pythonXX_d.lib missing. We know - use relWithDebInfo build target for now
* FreeImage lib not found by CMake - we'll specify some standard path to put dependencies into, for now please fill in the 
	path into the FREEIMAGE_PATH
