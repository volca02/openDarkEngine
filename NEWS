Changes in alpha release 0.1.4 (20-Aug-2006)
* Added the ability to do lightmap switching
* Added a console command "light ID Intensity". Note that the ID differes from the object ID.

Changes in alpha release 0.1.5 (02-Sep-2006)
* The water portals are really fixed now. The rendering of water works, but needs to be finished.
* Updated the documentation of the sources. It should be pretty complete now.
* The material scripts can be used (and are searched) prior to the simple texture-only default materials. Not too complete for now.
* Water material script added. If not found, water should be invisible.
* Added -Werror compiler flag.

Changes in alpha release 0.1.6 (17-Sep-2006)
* SceneManager is nearly cleaned up (needs finishing though)
* Level geometry is loaded outside the SceneManager class, in a new (and first) Service called worldrep
* Water rendering finally works, the material should be tweaked to look better
* SkyHack seems to work well now
* The levels are currently non-lit (No lightmaps), as the lightmapping needs final fix.

Changes in alpha release 0.1.7 (2-Oct-2006)
* Water portals rendering works even with the lightmaps. The materials are bad though - not looking as they should.
* Added/restructuralised the materials
* Added OpdeService, OpdeServiceFactory and some more. These will hopefully be a base classes for the services.
* Lightmaps are partially fixed. Swiched on by default now.
* Pre-add of the StructInfo sources (Thanks telliamed!). These should form the binary service later on (for universal binary file access using binary templates)
* Some sky box work
